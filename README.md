# This is a very simple tracker script for ESX framework.
In the script you have 2 commands, one is "TrackON" command that allows you to put the tracker on and then there is a "TrackOFF" command that allows you to set off the tracker

Script is 0.00ms in usage and 0.00ms on idle, there are only one loop in the server side.

You can pretty much change everything in the config.lua file.
